## Exercise 3: DOM Manipulation and Events

This is a short exercise to demonstrate how JavaScript can manipulate the DOM, and assign events to HTML elements. If you haven't already, fork and clone this repository. Then, edit the `js/main.js` to complete the outlined steps. Unlike the other exercises in this module, you will be able to view and test your code by interacting with the DOM.

# Module 3: JavaScript

## Overview
As you know, all visual elements on a webpage are HTML elements, styled using CSS: JavaScript is what will bring those elements to life.  JavaScript is a **scripting language** used to process data, create/manipulate HTML elements, and assign events (i.e, click, hover, etc.) to those elements.  The vast majority of the code you will write in this course will be JavaScript, and you should feel confident in your functional programming skills in the language.

Here are some helpful resources to help guide your exploration of JavaScript:

## Getting Started
JavaScript, a scripting language, differs substantially from markup languages such as HTML.  Using JavaScript, you'll create variables that **are not** represented in the DOM.  This will allow you to process data, apply conditional logic (i.e., `if/else` statements), and assign behaviors to elements that you select from your page.  For small applications, you may see JavaScript written directly in a `<script>` tag of an `index.html` file:

```html
<!-- index.html file -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  <script>
    // JavaScript code gets written in here
  </script>
```

However, it is a better practice to isolate your JavaScript code into another file, which you can read into your `index.html` file:

```html
<!-- index.html file -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/my-script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
```

If you read in your JavaScript file in the `<head>` section, it will (by default) run before the elements in your body are created.  This can become an issue if your JavaScript file attempts to select elements created in your `index.html` file (because they will not yet have been created).  Not to worry -- you can simply wait for your elements to be loaded before the code executes (you should wrap all of your code inside of this function):

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
  //do work
});
```

This looks a little nicer using the `jQuery` library:

```javascript
$( document ).ready(function() {
  // Handler for .ready() called.
});

// Or even more concisely:
$(function() {
  // Handler for .ready() called.
});
```
## Variables
Like other scripting languages, JavaScript allows you to store information inside of variables you create.  JavaScript is **loosely typed**, so there is no need to specify the type of variable you wish to create:

```javascript
// Create a numeric variable `x`
var x = 13;

// Create a string variable `str` using quotes (single or double quotes are both fine)
var str = "hello there";

// Create a variable `arr` that stores an array of values (which may be of different types)
var arr = [13, 'fourteen', 15];

// Access array elements by their index, starting at 0:
arr[0] // returns 13

// Create an object of key-values pairs -- note, these may be nested
var person = {
  name:'steve',
  favorites:{
    music:'bluegrass',
    foods:['pizza', 'salad', 'yogurt']
  }
};

// Access object values using their key-values
person.name // returns 'steve'
person.favorites // returns the full `favorites` objects
person.favorites.foods // returns ['pizza', 'salad', 'yogurt']
person.favorites.foods[1] // returns 'salad'

// Create a function that takes in a value and returns that values times two
var timesTwo = function(value) { return value * 2}

// Execute your function, passing in the value 3:
timesTwo(3) // returns 6
```

JavaScript objects have _**properties**_ and _**methods**_:

>**Properties**: describe a feature of an object, such as it's length.

>**Methods**: actions that an object can perform, such as push an element into an array.

Here are some brief examples for accessing properties/methods:

```javascript
// Create an array of data
var data = [1, 2, 3];

// Determine how many observations are in the dataset using the `length` property
num_obs = data.length;

// Add a new observation into the array of data using the `push` method
data.push(4) // data is now [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Use the filter methods to determine which numbers are greater than 2
greater_than_two = data.filter(function(d){return d>2 })

// Note: data is unchanged, and filter took a `function` as it's parameter.  
```

To practice accessing information via object properties, and leveraging different object methods, see [exercise-1](exercise-1).

## Variable Scope
When working with JavaScript, it is very important to understand the **scope** of your variables.  In JavaScript, `scope` refers to the context of your variable.  For example, is it defined everywhere (`global`) or just within a function (`local`). When you create a variable outside of any functions, that variable has `global` scope, and is accessible within any of your code:

```javascript
// Globally created variable: can reference it anywhere
var data = [1, 2, 3];
```
However, if you create a variable **within a function**, it will only be accessible within that function (or child functions):

```javascript
// Globally created variable: can reference it anywhere
var data = [1, 2, 3];

// Processing data function
var process_data = function(){
  // Local scope: Variables created in here are not accessible outside of this function
  var len = data.length

  // Internal function: `len` will be accessible
  var additional_processing = function() {
    // You can access `len` within internal functions
  }
};

// len is not accessible here: "Uncaught ReferenceError: len is not defined"
console.log(len)
```

This [blog-post](https://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/) is much more robust explanation of the topic, and you should seek it out ~~if~~ when you run into scoping problems.  

## Arrays
Perhaps the most common data structure you will work with is the `array`.  For example, when you read in a `.csv` file into your program, each row is typically interpreted as an element in an array.  Note, each one of those elements in the `array` is an `object`, with the key-value pairs representing the columns and values of the `.csv` file (more on this in [module-5](https://github.com/INFO-474/m5-data).)

A common task when working with arrays is to iterate through each element and pass that element into a function. For example, you may be adding a point to a map for each element in an array. While you could write a loop, this can also accomplished using the `map` method:

```javascript
// Array of numbers
var arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

// Function to return a value plus three
var plusThree = function(num) {
  return num + 3
}

// Pass each element in `arr` to the `plusThree` function
var threeLarger = arr.map(plusThree)

// This also could be done via an anonymous function
var threeLarger = arr.map(function(num){
  return num + 3
})

```

Note, this is similar to the `forEach` method, but the `forEach` method **does not** return a value.  To practice accessing information via object properties, and leveraging different object methods, see [exercise-2](exercise-2).

## DOM Manipulation
This is all well and good, but what does JavaScript have to do with your webpage? Similarly to how you can select elements using CSS, you can select elements from your DOM using JavaScript.  This will enable you to **get**, **add**, **change**, and **remove** elements from your webpage.  In [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-474/m4-jquery), we'll introduce the `jQuery` library that provides a much more succinct syntax for accomplishing the same tasks.  Under the hood, the `d3` library leverages the same processes, so it's important to understand what's happening (even if you will rarely use the native JavaScript syntax):

```javascript
// Set the innerHTML property of the element with id "demo"
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";

// Create a new element
var btn = document.createElement("button");  // Create an empty <button> element
var t = document.createTextNode("Click");    // Create a text node, which you'll append to the button
btn.appendChild(t);                          // Append the text to <button>
document.body.appendChild(btn);              // Append <button> to <body>

// Remove an element
var parent = document.getElementById("div1"); // Select parent by id
var child = document.getElementById("p1");    // Select child by id
parent.removeChild(child);                    // Remove child from parent
```

## Events
In addition to manipulating DOM elements, JavaScript enables you to assign dozens of [events](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp) to your webpage.  Events are the set of actions that a user can perform on your webpage such as keyboard or mouse actions, touch gestures, and many more. Any html element can register an event: in other words, any component on your page can trigger a function when it is acted upon.  Events can be assigned via different html attributes in their html tags:

```html
<button onclick="alert('hello')">Click me</button>
```

Note, the `onclick` event is assigned a JavaScript function, which is executed when it registers the event (i.e., when someone clicks on it).  You, of couse, can assign your own JavaScript functions to click events:

```html
<!-- your index.html file which has read in the javascript below -->
<button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>
```

```javascript
// JavaScript file that is read into your webpage
var myFunction = function() {
  // run your code here
};
```


While it's useful to assign events within you html file, it may be more flexible to assign these events dynamically from your JavaScript file.  Because you can select and change elements from you DOM, it's easy to assign events to your elements:

```javascript
var myFunction = function() {
  // code that you want to be executed
};
document.getElementById("myBtn").onclick = myFunction;
```
Again, this will become more succinct when we start using the jQuery library.  To practice assigning different event listeners, see [exercise-3](exercise-3).

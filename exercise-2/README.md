## Exercise 2: JavaScript Array Methods

This is a short exercise to demonstrate more advanced JavaScript array methods. If you haven't already, fork and clone this repository.  Then, edit the `js/main.js` to complete the outlined steps. Because the JavaScript variables you create will not be represented in the DOM, you'll need to open up the `index.html` file, then **inspect your webpage** and confirm you've properly created the variables by using the **console**.
